      - Corrected the Zero Utilization logic to only flag projects that are missing

    <a href='https://github.com/abtassociates/eva/issues/522' target='_blank'>#522</a>.",
    "10-07-2024",
    "<b>New Features:</b> <br>
      - Launched the System Performance Overview Page. The page contains three new 
    system performance charts: the System Flow Chart, the Client System Status Chart, 
    and the System Demographics Chart. The system performance charts give users flexibility 
    in how they filter and view their communityâ€™s homeless response system performance data.<br>
      - Updated how 'Data not collected' is handled when Eva assesses data quality. 
    Eva now classifies data elements marked in the export as 'Data not collected' 
    as a Warning instead of as an Error, to align with Eva's Error and Warning definitions. 
    This approach is aimed at helping HMIS end users focus on correcting fixable 
    issues without changing accurate information. The Warning is meant to remind 
    users to verify if the data might still be collected or if the data exists elsewhere, 
    such as in the client's file. If 'Data not collected' is the correct value, 
    users should leave the value as-is in HMIS. Issues that should be fixed in HMIS 
    are categorized as Errors.<br>
      - Removed logic that looks for nulls in specific data elements when Eva assesses 
    data quality. For the Race/Ethnicity, Gender, Veteran Status, Disabling Condition, 
    Name Data Quality, DOB Data Quality, SSN Data Quality, and Destination data 
    elements, the HMIS CSV export does not distinguish between nulls and the value 
    'Data not collected' The issues removed are: Missing Name Data Quality, Missing 
    DOB Data Quality, Missing SSN Data Quality, Missing Gender, Missing Veteran 
    Status, Missing Disabling Condition, and Missing Destination. These are now 
    flagged as Warnings and described as 'Unknown Gender,' 'Unknown Veteran Status,' etc.<br>
    <b>Bug Fixes:</b><br>
      - Improved handling of overlapping enrollments<br>
      - Fixed invalid move-in date (issue <a href='https://github.com/abtassociates/eva/issues/615' target='_blank'>#615</a>)<br>
      - Fixed the way Eva uses Project Participation and groups Projects that change 
    participation across the reporting date range. Addresses issues <a href='https://github.com/abtassociates/eva/issues/521' target='_blank'>#521</a> 
    and <a href='https://github.com/abtassociates/eva/issues/605' target='_blank'>#605</a>.",
    
    "08-01-2024",
    "<b>New Features:</b> <br>
      - Formatted changelog for readability <br>
