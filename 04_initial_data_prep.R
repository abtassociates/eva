# Purpose: ----------------------------------------------------------------

# This script creates the intermediate dataframes that are also used in various
# places, including:
# Enrollment, merged with other datasets and with added columns for faster access
# Project, merged with organization and with project type redefined to account
# for tracking method
# Services, limited to bed-nights only (record type = 200 and non-null date
# provided)
# validation, combining the Enrollment and Project, limited to non-null
# EntryDates, and limited to key fields
#
# Some definitions:
# PH = PSH + RRH
# household = one or more people who present for housing/homeless services
# served = the Entry to Exit Date range crosses the Report Date range
# entered = the Entry Date is inside the Report Date range
# moved_in = any stay in a non-PH project where the Entry to Exit Date range
#     crosses the Report Date range PLUS any stay in a PH project where the 
#     Move In Date to the Exit Date crosses the Report Date range
# hohs = heads of household
# adults = all adults in a household
# clients = all members of the household
