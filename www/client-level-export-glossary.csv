The corrected HoH variable keeps original Head of Household unless (1) the HoH is younger than 18 and in a household with adults, (2) there are multiple assigned HoHs in one enrollment, or (3) the HoH is unassigned. If the originally identified HoH is younger than 18, or if there are multiple or no HoHs associated with the enrollment, it will take the veteran in the household, if one exists.
