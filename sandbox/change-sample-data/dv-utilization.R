# remove enrollments from one of the dv projects --------------------------

# 2 projects in the sample data are represented twice in the HMISParticipation
# file because they switched from comparable db (ParticipationType = 2) to
# HMIS participating (ParticiationType = 1) These are projects 488 and 773.
# Both of them have enrollments in the enrollment file. I want to add nuance
# so that one of them does not have any enrollments.

# once you've run all this, you should be able to test two things:

# 1. if 488 is not flagged, that means the logic is not recognizing that
# that project was participating during the reporting period and thus should
# have some enrollments (even if they were previously or subsequently 
# participating in a comparable database.) so we want 488 to flag.

# 2. if 1800 flags (like it would in Eva live) that means Eva is incorrectly
# ignoring the fact that that project is not HMIS Participating and thus
# shouldn't have any enrollments. We do NOT want 1800 to flag.
