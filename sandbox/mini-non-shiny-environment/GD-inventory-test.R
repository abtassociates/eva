# in the dataset, the inventoryOUtsideOpererating df catches 1 instance of this
# issue where the inventory record is active and its StartDate precedes the 
# OpStart. In the code above, if you change the "Active == 0" to "Active == 1"
# you'll see the record that *is* flagging in Eva, which we want to flag. If you
# run it Active == 0, you  can see that there are a lot of records where the
# InventoryStart precedes the OpStart, but it's inactive so it isn't flagging in
# Eva, which is what we want.
