              project intended for local use by HMIS Administrators in Continuums
              of Care (CoCs) around the U.S. and its territories. Eva is designed 
              to help you (1) assess the accuracy and completeness of the data within 
              your HMIS, and (2) understand your homeless response system’s flow 
              and performance. Using Eva does not result in reporting or sharing 
              data with HUD and use of Eva is not required by HUD.</p>
              
              <p>Eva is a web-based tool built with R Shiny. This means:</p>
              <ul>

                <strong>no CoC data is being retained or viewed by anyone besides 
                you.</strong> Eva does retain metadata about the upload file itself,

                status, and data source information. This is collected for

              a .zip file with 23 csv files in it.
              <ul>
              <li>A hashed export means that the personal identifiers are obscured
              when the export is generated.</li>
              <li>The HMIS CSV Export has client-level data in it, so it must be

              dataset. <strong>If you wish to see your results again you will need to
              re-upload your hashed HMIS CSV Export file.</strong> To do so, you
              need to turn off Demo Mode. This will clear the sample HMIS data
              from the application so you can operate Eva as normal and upload
              your own HMIS data again.</p></div>

              <p>To upload your hashed HMIS CSV Export, click the \'Browse\'
              button. Once you find the zip file on your computer, click on it to select it, 
              and click \'Open\' to begin the upload. Eva might take a few moments 
              to process your selected file. Eva will first check to determine if 
              the export is hashed. If it is not, Eva will reject the file with 
              an error message, and clear Eva's memory. Eva will continue to do 
              this until you upload a hashed HMIS CSV Export.</p>
              
              <h4>HMIS CSV Export File Structure Analysis</h4>
              <p>After confirming your export is hashed, Eva will review and process 
              the file structure of your upload. The File Structure Analysis assesses 
              the structural components of the uploaded .zip file and determines 
              if it meets Eva’s file structure requirements, such as if the files 
              have all the right names, columns, data types, and allowable values etc.</p>
              
              <p>Once your upload is processed and Eva has finished assessing the 
              file structure integrity of your upload, Eva will provide a pop-up 
              message alerting you of your upload status. You can have either a 
              successful upload or an unsuccessful upload based on the structural 
              integrity of your HMIS CSV export. The key difference between a successful 
              upload and an unsuccessful upload is if the upload has any High Priority 
              File Structure Errors.</p>
              
              <p>While any error identified during the File Structure Analysis represent 
              components in the uploaded HMIS CSV export file that do not meet the 
              most recent <a href='https://files.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/HMIS-CSV-Format-Specifications-2024.pdf'
              target= '_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>HMIS CSV Format Specifications</a>, 
              there are some file structural errors that are more relevant to the 
              functionality of Eva.</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li><b>High Priority File Structure Errors</b> are file structure issues 
                that will cause Eva to not work.</li>
                <li><b>General File Structure Errors</b> are file structure issues that 
                will not impact Eva’s ability to work, but do not meet HMIS CSV 
                format specifications.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>If Eva identifies any High Priority File Structure Errors during 
              the File Structure Analysis that prevent Eva from functioning, Eva 
              will reject your upload and stop processing the export. You will thus 
              not be able to assess the data quality of your upload or analyze the 
              system performance of your homeless response system. For both successful 
              and unsuccessful uploads, all identified file structure errors will 
              display in the HMIS CSV File Structure Analysis panel, where you can 
              download the details.</p>
              
              <p>It is essential that you contact your HMIS vendor to resolve all 
              High Priority File Structure Errors identified in the HMIS CSV Export 
              File Structure Analysis, as well as any other structural issues which 
              you feel need to be corrected. Not all structural issues found in 
              this analysis will prevent the data from being accepted for analysis, 
              so they may not require immediate attention. Once your vendor has 
              addressed any High Priority File Structure Errors, you can attempt 
              another upload.</p>
              
              <p>Once you have uploaded a hashed and structurally sound .zip file, 
              you will see a confirmation that your upload was successful, the date 
              range of the files you uploaded, plus the date your Export was downloaded 
              from your HMIS. You will then be able to assess the data quality of 
              your upload and analyze the system performance of your homeless response system.</p>

               <h4>Client Counts Report</h4>
               <p>The Client Counts Report provides the number of households/clients
               who have been served in each project and their enrollment status
               at the time of CSV Export generation. This report can be used to
               verify that a project is up to date on their HMIS data entry by
               comparing counts reported with the number of households/clients
               that are known to be served in each project. Permanent housing
               projects can check that the number of households/clients who have
               not yet moved into housing is correct.</p>
               
               <h4>Inputs</h4>
               <p>Select a project from the drop list and adjust the the Date
               Range for the cohort of clients you want to see reported. The
               Date Range defaults to the date range covered by the HMIS CSV Export. 
               Users are encouraged to edit the Date Range as desired to see
               metrics for timeframes within the Export period, such as the
               number of households/clients who exited during that timeframe
               with and without a Move-In Date. Note that setting the Start Date
               to the Export End Date will show the current status for all
               enrollments for the project.</p>
               
               <h4>Summary</h4>
               <p>The Summary panel provides a count of households/clients who
               have statuses of the following within the selected project:
               <ul>
               <li>Active No Move-In Date</li>
               <li>Currently Moved In</li>
               <li>Exited No Move-In</li>

               </ul>
               
               <h4>Client Counts Detail</h4>
               <p>In this panel you will see the Personal ID, Relationship to HoH,
               Entry Date, Move-In Date, Exit Date, and the Status for each client
               served by the selected project within the Date Range selected. The
               rows are ordered by Entry Date (oldest on top), Household ID (not
               visible), and Personal ID. This enables users to see the oldest
               enrollments first and groups clients in the same household
               together. All columns are searchable. For example, to find all
               enrollments with a Status of \'Active No Move-In Date\', you can
               type \'act\' in the Status search bar and the data table will
               react and filter in that way.

               so they can work on correcting their data. Feel free to modify, 
               add, or remove anything as you see fit. For example, you may want 
               your users to only address High Priority issues right now. You can
               easily remove any tabs that may distract your users from that goal.
               Please note that Overlaps will be shown in the 'Warnings' tab and

                <p>The System Performance Overview page in Eva features three system 
                performance charts: the System Flow Chart, the Client System Status 
                Chart, and the System Demographics Chart. The charts display system 
                performance data, pulled from your uploaded HMIS CSV export, from 
                all HMIS Continuum projects, excluding homeless prevention projects. 
                Eva uses the last 12 full months of data in the upload, which constitutes 
                the report period. <b>Note that some charts on this page may not display 
                if the uploaded HMIS CSV export has less than 12 full months of data.</b></p>
                
                <p>The purpose of the system performance charts is to use your HMIS 
                data to (1) evaluate how effective your homeless system is in moving 
                clients through the system and helping them reach permanent housing, 
                and (2) help you understand the demographic composition of all clients 
                served in your homeless system. Explore each of the charts using 
                chart tabs beneath the Filters Menu. Under each chart tab is a Chart 
                subtab for viewing the chart itself and an Information subtab. The 
                Information subtab includes a \"Chart Overview” section that provides 
                guidance on how to read the chart, and some charts additionally have 
                an \"Interpretation Tips” section that can help you interpret their output.</p>
                
                <p>Use the Filters Menu to explore system performance trends of 
                clients in your homeless system with specific characteristics. 
                This has two components: </p>
                
                <ol>
                  <li><b>The universal filters</b>, the top row of the Filters Menu, 
                  impact the data shown on all three visualizations on this page. 
                  Universal filters include Household Type, Level of Detail, Project 
                  Type Group, and Gender and Race/Ethnicity Methodology Type.</li>
                  <li><b>The demographic filters</b>, the bottom row of the Filters Menu, 
                  only impact the data shown in the System Flow and Client System 
                  Status charts. Demographic filters include Age, Veteran Status, 
                  Gender, and Race/Ethnicity.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>Use the drop-down menus to select the characteristics of the 
                system subpopulation you want to analyze. The default selection 
                is all clients in your homeless system throughout the report period. 
                To see system performance by households, select the \"Head of Households 
                only” level of detail. All filters (except one) are single-select, 
                meaning you can only select one category at a time. For the Age 
                filter, you can select multiple age ranges to explore.</p>
                
                <p>The Gender and Race/Ethnicity Methodology Type selection only 
                impacts the Gender and Race/Ethnicity filters. To learn more about 
                methodology and demographic categories, please visit the Glossary 
                accessible on Eva’s Navigation Menu.</p>
                
                <h4>Downloads</h4>
                <p>To support further systems analysis, local reporting, and presentations, 
                Eva includes two download options. To generate an Excel workbook 
                with the data for a specific chart, click the \"Data Download” button 
                while viewing the chart. To generate a PowerPoint slide deck with 
                the chart image, click the \"Image Download” button while viewing the chart. </p>
                
                <h4>Data Suppression and Data Security</h4>
                <p>To ensure the privacy and protection of individuals and small 
                population groups, Eva uses varying levels of data suppression. 
                If the total number of clients within a chart is less than 11, the 
                chart will not display. When this happens, you may need to broaden 
                your filter selections or upload a larger dataset to ensure there 
                is enough data to view the chart. A chart that is not displayed 
                cannot be exported in Excel or PowerPoint.</p>
                
                <p>The data in the data download of a chart’s export <b>will not be 
                suppressed</b>. Be careful how you save and share the tabular export. 
                With smaller numbers, clients can become more identifiable in the 
                data. Before you share the Excel export, feel free to modify, add, 
                or remove anything as you see fit to preserve client anonymity. </p>

                                <p>The System Flow chart shows your homeless system's 
                                inflow and outflow during the period, helping you 
                                assess the effectiveness of your homeless system. 
                                The client universe for this chart is the number 
                                of clients identified as active in your system at 
                                the start of the report period plus the number of 
                                clients that inflowed into your system during the 
                                period. There are two views for this chart: the 
                                Summary Chart view and the Detail Chart view. Both 
                                views show the total number of clients active in 
                                the system at the start and end of the period and 
                                whether they are homeless at that time or housed 
                                (and still receiving assistance).</p>
                                
                                <p>The Summary Chart shows the inflow and outflow 
                                of clients that occurred throughout the period. 
                                The Detail Chart breaks down inflow and outflow 
                                into several categories.</p>

                                  <li><b>Inflow</b> is categorized into three groups: 
                                  \"First-Time Homeless,\" \"Returned from Permanent,\" and 
                                  \"Re-engaged from Non-Permanent.\"</li>
                                  <li><b>Outflow</b> is divided into three categories: 
                                  \"Exited, Non-Permanent,\" \"Exited, Permanent,\" and \"Inactive.\"</li>
                                </ul>
                                
                                <p>The System Flow chart is read from 
                                left to right. The Total Change value represents 
                                the Outflow value(s) minus Inflow value(s). The 
                                Total Change value can be positive or negative. 
                                A negative change value means more clients left 
                                your system than flowed into your system. A positive 
                                change value means more clients flowed into your 
                                system than left your system.</p>

                                    <td>The \"First-Time Homeless” category refers 
                                    to someone who has not been served in the system 
                                    within the 24 months prior to their entry. Therefore, 
                                    it is not possible to assess if people are newly 
                                    homeless or returners/re-engagers without a 36-month 
                                    dataset. Thus, because of the shorter timeframe 
                                    of your export, the number of returners/re-engagers 
                                    may be an undercount.</td>

                                    Therefore, it will be difficult to draw conclusions about 
                                    whether changes in inflow/outflow are meaningful. 
                                    For instance, change in inflow/outflow over a 
                                    4-month period may reflect expected seasonal shifts 
                                    instead of a difference in system performance.

                                <p>The Client System Status Chart shows the end-of-year 
                                housing status of the clients that were active in 
                                your homeless response system at the start of the 
                                period. This chart helps you identify the proportion 
                                of clients that ended the period as (1) homeless 
                                or (2) housed or in permanent housing. The client 
                                universe for this chart is the number of clients 
                                active in your system at the start of the report 
                                period. This chart does not include clients that 
                                inflowed into your system after the start of the

                                are identified as either \"Homeless” or \"Housed.” 
                                The right-hand bar labeled \"Period End” in the chart 
                                shows the status of these clients at the end of 
                                the period. Clients are categorized into five system 
                                statuses at the end of the period: \"Exited, Non-Permanent,” 
                                \"Enrolled, Homeless,” \"Inactive,” \"Exited, Permanent,” 
                                and \"Enrolled, Housed.”</p>

                                of the period to their status at the end of the 
                                period through visible linkages that connect the 
                                two bars. The width of each linkage represents the 
                                proportion of clients that make up that linkage. 
                                Meaning, the thicker the linkage, the larger proportion 
                                of clients it represents.</p>

               for reporting to interested entities about your overall HMIS
               system data quality.</p>
               <p>Click the Download button to generate an Excel workbook with
               the your entire system's Data Quality data. Feel free to modify,
               add, or remove anything as you see fit. For example, if you are
               sending this workbook to your CoC management, you may want to 
               remove the tabs that have client-level data on them.

               and Warnings) you will find two plots: one plots the counts of
               issues and one plots the number of issues by organization.</p>
               
               <h5><b>Top 10 Issues</b></h5>
               <p>Across all of the organizations in your upload, this plot shows
               the <b>top 10</b> issues identified in the data quality scan. This
               result can help to focus future end-user trainings and bring to
               light any potential considerations in your federal or local
               reporting and analysis.</p>
               
               <h5><b>Top 10 Organizations</b></h5>
               <p>These plots show the <b>top 10</b> organizations across your
               system with the highest number of issues identified. You can use
               these plots to help determine which organizations may need extra
