               <p>For each type of issue (High Priority Errors, General Errors,
               and Warnings) you will find two plots: one graphing the number of
               issues by type, and one graphing the number of issues by project.

               <h4>Top 10 Issues</h4>
               <p>Across all the projects within the selected Organization, this
               plot shows the <b>top 10</b> issues identified. This can be
               useful in planning targeted HMIS training efforts.</p>
          
               <h4>Top 10 Projects</h4>
               <p>These plots show the <b>top 10</b> projects within the selected
               organization with the highest number of issues identified. You can
               use this to help determing which projects may need extra assistance
               in addressing their data quality issues.</p>

                <p>The System Performance Overview page in Eva features three system 
                performance charts: the System Flow Chart, the Client System Status 
                Chart, and the System Demographics Chart. The charts display system 
                performance data, pulled from your uploaded HMIS CSV export, from 
                all HMIS Continuum projects, excluding homeless prevention projects. 
                Eva uses the last 12 full months of data in the upload, which constitutes 
                the report period. <b>Note that some charts on this page may not display 
                if the uploaded HMIS CSV export has less than 12 full months of data.</b></p>
                
                <p>The purpose of the system performance charts is to use your HMIS 
                data to (1) evaluate how effective your homeless system is in moving 
                clients through the system and helping them reach permanent housing, 
                and (2) help you understand the demographic composition of all clients 
                served in your homeless system. Explore each of the charts using 
                chart tabs beneath the Filters Menu. Under each chart tab is a Chart 
                subtab for viewing the chart itself and an Information subtab. The 
                Information subtab includes a \"Chart Overview” section that provides 
                guidance on how to read the chart, and some charts additionally have 
                an \"Interpretation Tips” section that can help you interpret their output.</p>
                
                <p>Use the Filters Menu to explore system performance trends of 
                clients in your homeless system with specific characteristics. 
                This has two components: </p>
                
                <ol>
                  <li><b>The universal filters</b>, the top row of the Filters Menu, 
                  impact the data shown on all three visualizations on this page. 
                  Universal filters include Household Type, Level of Detail, Project 
                  Type Group, and Race/Ethnicity Methodology Type.</li>
                  <li><b>The demographic filters</b>, the bottom row of the Filters Menu, 
                  only impact the data shown in the System Flow and Client System 
                  Status charts. Demographic filters include Age, Veteran Status, 
                  and Race/Ethnicity.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>Use the drop-down menus to select the characteristics of the 
                system subpopulation you want to analyze. The default selection 
                is all clients in your homeless system throughout the report period. 
                To see system performance by households, select the \"Head of Households 
                only” level of detail. All filters (except one) are single-select, 
                meaning you can only select one category at a time. For the Age 
                filter, you can select multiple age ranges to explore.</p>
                
                <p>Please note that household type and age group filters use different 
                methods for calculating a client's age. Household type is based on all 
                household members’ ages as of the entry date of their earliest enrollment 
                included in the report period. Age group is determined based on the client’s 
                age as of the entry date of their last enrollment included in the report period. 
                Because of this reporting difference, it is possible for a client that ages from 
                24 to 25 during the report period to be categorized in the Adult Only 18-24 
                household type while also being categorized as in the 25-34 age group.</p>
                
                <p>The Race/Ethnicity Methodology Type selection only impacts the 
                Race/Ethnicity filters. To learn more about methodology and demographic 
                categories, please visit the Glossary accessible on Eva's Navigation Menu.</p>
                
                <h4>Downloads</h4>
                <p>To support further systems analysis, local reporting, and presentations, 
                Eva includes two download options. To generate an Excel workbook 
                with the data for a specific chart, click the \"Data Download\" button 
                while viewing the chart. To generate a PowerPoint slide deck with 
                the chart image, click the \"Image Download\" button while viewing the chart. </p>
                
                <h4>Data Suppression and Data Security</h4>
                <p>To ensure the privacy and protection of individuals and small 
                population groups, Eva uses varying levels of data suppression. 
                If the total number of clients within a chart is less than 11, the 
                chart will not display. When this happens, you may need to broaden 
                your filter selections or upload a larger dataset to ensure there 
                is enough data to view the chart. A chart that is not displayed 
                cannot be exported in Excel or PowerPoint.</p>
                
                <p>The data in the data download of a chart’s export <b>will not be 
                suppressed</b>. Be careful how you save and share the tabular export. 
                With smaller numbers, clients can become more identifiable in the 
                data. Before you share the Excel export, feel free to modify, add, 
                or remove anything as you see fit to preserve client anonymity. </p>

                                A negative change value means more clients left

                                    of your export, the number of returners/re-engagers 
                                    may be an undercount.</td>

                                    Therefore, it will be difficult to draw conclusions about 
                                    whether changes in inflow/outflow are meaningful. 
                                    For instance, change in inflow/outflow over a 
                                    4-month period may reflect expected seasonal shifts 
                                    instead of a difference in system performance.

                                included in the report period. Age group is determined based on the client’s 
                                age as of the entry date of their last enrollment included in the report period. 
                                Because of this reporting difference, it is possible for a client that ages from 
                                24 to 25 during the report period to be categorized in the Adult Only 18-24

               <h4>System-wide HMIS Data Quality Plots</h4>
               <p>For each type of issue (High Priority Errors, General Errors,
               and Warnings) you will find two plots: one plots the counts of
               issues and one plots the number of issues by organization.</p>
               
               <h5><b>Top 10 Issues</b></h5>
               <p>Across all of the organizations in your upload, this plot shows
               the <b>top 10</b> issues identified in the data quality scan. This
               result can help to focus future end-user trainings and bring to
               light any potential considerations in your federal or local
               reporting and analysis.</p>
               
               <h5><b>Top 10 Organizations</b></h5>
               <p>These plots show the <b>top 10</b> organizations across your
               system with the highest number of issues identified. You can use
               these plots to help determine which organizations may need extra
               assistance in getting their HMIS Errors/Warnings resolved.</p>
